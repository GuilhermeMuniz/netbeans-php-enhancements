Netbeans PHP Editor Extensions:

Currently this module has two little features:

1. PHP Coding Standards Support for the Todolist Window
2. Additionall "Show Coding Standards Violations" for Inline Highlighting of Violations

No Warranty whatsoever for this, it might break your Netbeans ;-)

Only tested with netbeans 6.7, uses APIs that are not in 6.5.

The module automatically scans for the "phpcs" executable inside the enviroment path.
