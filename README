PHP Code Sniffer Support for Netbeans PHP. Right Click on an Open file:
=>  "Check Coding Standards"

No Warranty whatsoever for this, it might break your Netbeans ;-)

Only tested with netbeans 6.7, uses APIs that are not in 6.5

Only works on unix, since i hardcoded the execution of the Coding Sniffer to:

/usr/bin/phpcs2

You have to create a script at this location which does the following:

#!/bin/bash
phpcs --standard=Zend --report=xml "$1" > "$2"
