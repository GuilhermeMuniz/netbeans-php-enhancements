Netbeans PHP Editor Extensions:
==============================

No Warranty whatsoever for this, it might break your Netbeans ;-)
Only tested with netbeans 6.7, uses APIs that are not in 6.5.
The module automatically scans for the "phpcs" executable inside the enviroment path.

Currently this module has two little features:

1. PHP Coding Standards Support for the Tasks Window
2. Additionall "Show Coding Standards Violations" for Inline Highlighting of Violations

TASK WINDOW
==============

Open up the Tasks Window from "Window - Tasks" or CTRL+6.

To enable the Todo List CS Scanning you have to right click on the Filter Icon
and Select "Edit". Add a New Filter "Coding Standards" and activate only "PHP Coding Standards"
as task group and confirm. Then you have to click the uppermost icon on the left
of the tasks window that enables "Current File Scope".

For performance reasons the PHPCS plugin will only work in this mode, which
means only the coding standard violations of the current file are shown
in the task window.

SHOW CODING VIOLATIONS
======================

Per right click on the Editor window you can select "Show Coding Standard" which
highlights lines with warnings and errors. This highlights disappear when the file
is changed and saved.

CONFIGURE CODING-STANDARD
=========================

Currently the coding standard can only be changed by digging in the Netbeans config.

On a linux System open:

/home/<username>/.netbeans/6.7/config/Preferences.properties

On windows open:

C:\Users\<user>\..setingsorsuch..\.netbeans\6.7\config\Preferences.properties

Set:
phpcs.codingStandard=

To the name of your Coding Standard, for example PHPCS, Zend or such.
