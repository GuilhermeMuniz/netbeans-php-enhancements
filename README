Netbeans PHP Editor Extensions:
==============================

No Warranty whatsoever for this, it might break your Netbeans ;-)
Only tested with netbeans 6.7, uses APIs that are not in 6.5.
The module automatically scans for the "phpcs" executable inside the enviroment path.

Currently this module has two little features:

1. PHP Coding Standards Support for the Todolist Window
2. Additionall "Show Coding Standards Violations" for Inline Highlighting of Violations

TODOLIST WINDOW
==============

To enable the Todo List CS Scanning you have to right click on the Filter Icon
and Select "Coding Standards". Then you ahve to click the uppermost icon that
enables "Current File Scope".

For performance reasons the PHPCS plugin will only work in this mode, which
means only the coding standard violations of the current file are shown
in the task window.
